# What is JavaScript

Web development tools allow you to test and debug the JavaScript code. Web development tools are often called devtools. Modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera provide the devtools as built-in features.Generally, devtools allow you to work with a variety of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript.


```js
<!--  this comment is here to demonstrate an extremely long line length, well beyond what you should probably allow in your own code, though sometimes you'll be highlighting code you can't refactor, which is unfortunate but should be handled gracefully -->
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => setData(response.data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Markdown!</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

## ECMA Script




ECMAScript **ES** is a standardized scripting language specification that defines the core features and syntax of JavaScript. It provides guidelines for implementing JavaScript in web browsers and other environments.

The term **ECMAScript** originated from the organization that oversees the standardization process, known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). The ECMA-262 standard document defines the specification for ECMAScript.
Here are some of the major versions of ECMAScript and their notable features:

1. **ECMAScript 5 (ES5)**:
   - Added strict mode for more secure and optimized code.
   - Introduced JSON support with methods like `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.
   - Enhanced array methods like `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
   - Improved error handling with `try-catch` statements.

2. **ECMAScript 6 (ES6) / ECMAScript 2015**:
   - Introduced arrow functions `() => {}` for more concise function syntax.
   - Added `let` and `const` keywords for block-scoped variable declarations.
   - Introduced classes, allowing for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
   - Introduced template literals for more flexible string interpolation.
   - Enhanced object syntax with shorthand property names and computed property names.
   - Introduced modules for better code organization and encapsulation.

3. **ECMAScript 2016 (ES2016) and ECMAScript 2017 (ES2017)**:
   - Introduced the exponential operator `*` for calculating exponentiation.
   - Added `async` and `await` keywords for handling asynchronous operations.
   - Introduced the `includes()` method for checking if an array includes a specific value.
   - Added improvements to objects and arrays, such as `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`, `Array.prototype.includes()`, and trailing commas in function parameter lists.

4. **ECMAScript 2018 (ES2018) and ECMAScript 2019 (ES2019)**:
   - Introduced rest and spread operators `...` for working with arrays and objects.
   - Added asynchronous iteration with `for-await-of` loop.
   - Introduced new regular expression features like named capture groups and lookbehind assertions.
   - Added optional catch binding to conditionally catch exceptions without creating a variable.


5. **ECMAScript 2020 (ES2020) and ECMAScript 2021 (ES2021)**:
   - Introduced the nullish coalescing operator `??` to provide a default value for nullish (null or undefined) values.
   - Added optional chaining operator `?.` to access nested properties without causing errors if intermediate values are nullish.
   - Introduced the `BigInt` type for working with arbitrarily large integers.
   - Added logical assignment operators `||=`, `&&=` for concise assignment with conditions.
   - Introduced private class fields using `#` symbol for encapsulation.

These are just some of the key features introduced in each ECMAScript version. It's important to note that new features are continually added to ECMAScript through new versions and proposals, allowing JavaScript to evolve and provide more powerful and expressive capabilities for developers.
