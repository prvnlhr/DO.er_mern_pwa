# Functions as First-Class Citizens in JavaScript

In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions are not just blocks of code; they can also be treated as data. You can store functions in variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, and even return them from other functions. This powerful concept allows for more flexible and expressive programming patterns.

## Storing Functions in Variables

You can store a function in a variable just like you would with any other value. This enables you to reference and use the function through the variable.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let sum = add; // Assign the function to the variable sum
```

Now, you can call the function using the variable `sum`:

```javascript
let result = sum(10, 20); // Call the function using the variable
console.log(result); // Output: 30
```

## Passing Functions as Arguments

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. This allows you to create more dynamic and customizable behavior in your code.

```javascript
function calculate(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b); // Call the operation function with arguments
}

let result = calculate(sum, 5, 3); // Pass the sum function as an argument
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

In this example, the `calculate` function takes an `operation` function as an argument and uses it to perform a calculation.

## Returning Functions from Functions

You can also return a function from another function. This is particularly useful for creating specialized or reusable functions.

```javascript
function multiply(factor) {
  return function(x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

let double = multiply(2); // Returns a function that doubles its argument
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
```

Here, the `multiply` function returns a new function that multiplies its argument by the specified factor. This concept is known as a closure and is a fundamental concept in functional programming.

## Using Functions for Sorting

Functions as first-class citizens are useful for tasks like sorting arrays. You can pass custom comparison functions to the `sort` method to define how elements should be sorted.

```javascript
function compareBy(propertyName) {
  return function(a, b) {
    return a[propertyName] - b[propertyName];
  };
}

let products = [
  { name: 'iPhone', price: 900 },
  { name: 'Samsung Galaxy', price: 850 },
  { name: 'Sony Xperia', price: 700 },
];

products.sort(compareBy('price')); // Sort products by price
console.table(products);
```

In this example, the `compareBy` function returns a comparison function that can be used to sort objects based on a specified property.

## Conclusion

Understanding functions as first-class citizens in JavaScript allows you to create more flexible, modular, and expressive code. You can leverage functions just like any other data type, leading to more powerful and elegant programming patterns. Whether you're storing functions in variables, passing them as arguments, or returning them from other functions, this concept opens up a world of possibilities for creating dynamic and sophisticated applications.
