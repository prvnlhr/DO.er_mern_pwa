## Virtual Functions and Virtual Tables:

**Virtual Functions** are functions declared in the base class using the `virtual` keyword. They enable dynamic polymorphism by allowing derived classes to provide their own implementations. The decision about which version of the function to call is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, rather than its declared type.

**Virtual Tables (vtables)** are data structures maintained by compilers to implement dynamic binding. Each class with at least one virtual function has its own vtable, which contains pointers to the virtual functions. When an object's virtual function is called, the vtable is consulted to find the appropriate function to execute.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        // Base class implementation
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        // Derived class implementation
    }
};
```

In this example, the `draw` function in the `Circle` class overrides the `draw` function in the `Shape` class. The decision about which `draw` function to call is resolved at runtime based on the actual object type.

## Using `override` Keyword:

The `override` keyword is used to explicitly indicate that a function in a derived class is intended to override a virtual function in the base class. It helps catch errors at compile-time if the intended function doesn't actually override a base class function.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void print() {
        // Base class implementation
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void print() override {
        // Derived class implementation
    }
};
```

Using `override` ensures that the function signature in the derived class matches the one in the base class, preventing accidental hiding of functions due to typos or incorrect signatures.

## `final` Keyword and Preventing Overriding:

The `final` keyword is used to prevent a virtual function from being overridden in derived classes. It's placed after the function declaration in the base class, indicating that no further overriding is allowed.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void foo() final {
        // Base class implementation
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Error: Cannot override a final function
    // void foo() override { }
};
```

By using `final`, you ensure that a particular function remains unchanged in all derived classes, preventing further modifications or potential issues.

In summary, virtual functions and virtual tables enable dynamic polymorphism by allowing objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common base class. The `override` keyword ensures proper function overriding in derived classes, and the `final` keyword prevents further overriding of virtual functions. These concepts collectively provide the foundation for creating flexible, maintainable, and safe object-oriented programs in C++.
