# Basics of JavaScript 


JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:
1. ECMAScript: It provides the core functionality of JavaScript.
2. Document Object Model (DOM): It provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages.
3. Browser Object Model (BOM): It provides the browser API for interacting with the web browser.

JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to a web page by enhancing its functionality, such as validating forms, creating interactive maps, and displaying animated charts. When a web page is loaded, the JavaScript code is executed by the web browser's JavaScript engine. The engine modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically.

JavaScript engines, initially implemented as interpreters, are now commonly implemented as just-in-time compilers for improved performance.JavaScript can be used both on the client-side (in web browsers) and the server-side. Node.js is a popular server-side environment for JavaScript, enabling access to databases, file systems, etc.

## JavaScript History

- Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, initially named Mocha and later LiveScript.
- Renamed to JavaScript to leverage Java's popularity.
- JavaScript 1.0 was released with Netscape Navigator 2, followed by JavaScript 1.1 with Netscape Navigator 3.
- Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3 (IE 3) introduced JScript as its own JavaScript implementation.
- JavaScript was standardized by ECMA, resulting in ECMAScript (ISO/IEC-16262) to define a general-purpose cross-platform scripting language.

## ECMA Script

ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language specification that defines the core features and syntax of JavaScript. It provides guidelines for implementing JavaScript in web browsers and other environments.

The term <span>ECMAScript</span> originated from the organization that oversees the standardization process, known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). The ECMA-262 standard document defines the specification for ECMAScript.

Here are some of the major versions of ECMAScript and their notable features:

1. **ECMAScript 5 (ES5):**
    - Added strict mode for more secure and optimized code.
    - Introduced JSON support with methods like `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.
    - Enhanced array methods like `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
    - Improved error handling with `try-catch` statements.

2. **ECMAScript 6 (ES6) / ECMAScript 2015:**

    - Introduced arrow functions `() => {}` for more concise function syntax.
    - Added `let` and `const` keywords for block-scoped variable declarations.
    - Introduced classes, allowing for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
    - Introduced template literals for more flexible string interpolation.
    - Enhanced object syntax with shorthand property names and computed property names.
    - Introduced modules for better code organization and encapsulation.
