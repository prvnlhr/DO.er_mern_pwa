## Origins of JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts.



1. **ECMAScript**: It provides the core functionality of JavaScript.
2. **Document Object Model (DOM):** It provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages.
3. **Browser Object Model (BOM):** It provides the browser API for interacting with the web browser.

JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to a web page by enhancing its functionality, such as validating forms, creating interactive maps, and displaying animated charts. When a web page is loaded, the JavaScript code is executed by the web browser's JavaScript engine. The engine modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically.

JavaScript engines, initially implemented as interpreters, are now commonly implemented as just-in-time compilers for improved performance.

JavaScript can be used both on the client-side (in web browsers) and the server-side. Node.js is a popular server-side environment for JavaScript, enabling access to databases, file systems, etc.
